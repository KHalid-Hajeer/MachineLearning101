# Machine Learning 101
Everything you need to fully understand machine learning. 

For each machine learning model, I will:
i) **Introduce the Model:** Overview of its history, evolution, and applications.
ii) **Identify Problems and Patterns:** Explore the types of problems it addresses and the challenges it solves.
iii) **Explain the Methodology:** Outline the approach, math, and assumptions behind the model.
iv) **Build it from scratch:** Code the model from first principles, breaking it down from a theoretical standpoint.
v) **Uncertainty:** Explore the sources of uncertainty in the model and how it impacts prediction reliability
vi) **Apply to Datasets:** Implement the model on real datasets and assess performance and scalability.
vii) **Build with a Library:** Rebuild the model using a machine learning library (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
viii) **Compare Models:** Compare the manual vs library-based models and their trade-offs
ix) **Optimise the Manual Model:** Refine the manual model to try to match the library-based version
